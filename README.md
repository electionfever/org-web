What is Election Fever?

This is a project in creating tools to facilitate engagement in the election process. People need to be aware of midterms, primaries, candidates, initiatives, districts, and a whole lot of factors that affect turnout and involvement in the process. We're hoping we can help out with this. Please join the project if you'd like to help make a difference.

electionfever.org - this site. Open source code powered by a static site generator. On electionfever.org we would like to describe the organization, and welcome anyone interested in helping.

First project will be to build a chat bot for various platforms, (Facebook Messenger, Microsoft, Google, Siri, Alexa). This bot will be an open source project but the data obtained will be for the organization's purposes. As such, a privacy policy will need to be in place to assure that this data is secure and only collected for the purposes of the project mission.

electionfever.net - this currently exists as a GNU social installation, with exactly one subscribed user so far (me). At some point this can be torn down and put somewhere else such as another subdomain (social.electionfever.org or net?). 


other ideas?

A discourse forum? A more interactive web site?
